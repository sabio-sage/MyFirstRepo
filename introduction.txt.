Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Ntow Wise, a young and passionate researcher and problem-solver from Suhum, Ghana, with a background in General Science. 
I have a deep interest in exploring how technology and community-led initiatives can be used to solve real-world problems.
In my free time, I enjoy reading and watching content on how technology is transforming our everyday lives. I also like to do more research works.
Currently, my research focuses on the harmful impacts of illegal mining (galamsey) and deforestation in my community. 
My aim is to propose sustainable, practical strategies that not only protect our natural resources but also provide alternative livelihoods for youth and local residents.
